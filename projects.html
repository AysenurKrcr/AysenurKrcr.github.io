                    <p>The series begins with the Original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919, where a pregnant Hayley has also settled.

                        In their absence, Klaus's protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis), took charge of the city. 
                        Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. 
                        While doing that they must also protect their city from a war brewing between vampires, werewolves, and witches.
                        Over time, new and old friendships are formed, love is in the air, death surrounds them, and the Originals learn more about their own family past. </p>

                    Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are suspicious of Holmes at first, over time, his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value.
